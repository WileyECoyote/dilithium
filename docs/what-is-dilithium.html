  What is Dilithium?
  <p/>
    Dilithium is simple program intended to simplfiy the task of starting the
  fvwm window manager with the crystal interface, fvwm-crystal. Dilithium can
  be started as a daemon from an init.d script or as a simple command line
  launcher like startx or xinit.
  <p/>
    Dilithium is intended to make it easy to use fvwm-crystal on systems that
  do not boot straight into a 1-gui system.
  <p/>
    Most Linux distribution install a default X server and display manager
  combination. These systems are pre-configured and typically work quite well
  but tend to be heavy-weight and customization is limited to simple schemes
  called themes. Themes contain a set or collection of schemes. A theme could
  be a single font, a single icon or a barrage of back-ground images and color
  configurations. There is no real definition of what constitutes a "theme".
  <p/>
    Another option is to use an alternative display manager. These Alternatives
  are typically available through distributions but are not so "integrated"
  with the system since the distributor was primarily focused on integrating
  the "chosen" display manager. One of these alternative is fvwm-crystal.
  <p/>
    Crystal is a some-what extreme example of display manager customization.
  Crystal is actually a theme for the fvwm display manager. Unlike the simple
  schemes used with gnome based display managers, Crystal is more of a
  programmable theme that can quickly transform the appearance of the user
  interface. One obstacle to using any alternative display manager is getting
  it started. This is not unique to fvwm or crystal, it is more a side-effect
  of having the system pre-configured for the "chosen" display manager. This
  can be an issue for fvwm-crystal in particular be fvwm lacks a native login
  scheme. An alternative is to configure a session manager such a Xsm.
  <p/>
    Dilithium provides a login session for fvwm. This feature is invoked
  automatically if the user information is unknown.
