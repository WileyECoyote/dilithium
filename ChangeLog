    * Makefile.am: Revise to allow building Doxygen documentation from the
      top of the source tree.

    * docs/dilithium.dox: Specify WARN_LOGFILE = ../dilithium-doxygen.log.

    * docs/dilithium.1.in: Update phrasing and minor formatting.

    * src/spawner.cc: Include "resource.h", not sure why this is need now
      and not 4 years ago -- need to tests on other platforms. Add header.
